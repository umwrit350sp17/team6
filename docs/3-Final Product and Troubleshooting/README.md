This folder serves as a guide for what our viewers should see as a final product when making their schedule. Additionally, we offer common problems that students may face when creating their schedule through this program. The media for this folder can be found in the assets file, and all contents were written using markdown. 

For our instructions and user guide to make the most sense, we recommend accessing this folder after you have read and completed the steps in the [Introduction to ClassScheduler](1-Introduction%20to%20ClassScheduler) folder and the [Using ClassScheduler to Make a Personal Scheduler](2-Using%20ClassScheduler%20to%20Make%20a%20Personal%20Schedule) folder: [Final Product and Troubleshooting](Final%20Product%20and%20Troubleshooting.md)
