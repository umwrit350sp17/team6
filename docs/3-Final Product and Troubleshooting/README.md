* For our instructions and user guide to make the most sense, we recommend accessing this page **_after_** you have **read** and **completed** the steps on the [Introduction to ClassScheduler](11-Introduction%20to%20ClassScheduler) page and in the [Using ClassScheduler to Make a Personal Scheduler](2-Using%20ClassScheduler%20to%20Make%20a%20Personal%20Schedule) folder.

* This page serves as a **guide** for what our viewers should see as a final product when making their schedule. Additionally, we offer _common problems_ that students may face when creating their schedule through this program.

So, we have developed a common "troubleshooting" page for you to refer to when you experience a technical issue.
