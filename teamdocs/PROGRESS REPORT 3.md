#### **Group Problems:**

Marcianne and Alix were feeling distrust towards their third team member, Maia, for her failure to participate in week one, her failure to respond in week two, and now, her completion of unacceptable work, as outlined in the team charter, in week three. So, Alix contacted the professor about Marcianne's concerns and her own concerns, and he suggested that Alix address her and outline what Maia committed to do, but did not. Alix complied with his suggestion, but the result backfired. It appeared that Maia no longer agreed to communicate via Slack, and she had taken a professional concern and turned it into a personal one against herself. Maia did reevaluate and redo her portion of the work, and it was significantly better. However, as with all portions of the project, there will need to be revision changes made before final submission. 

#### **Late Status Reports:**

* Each group member has checked in.
