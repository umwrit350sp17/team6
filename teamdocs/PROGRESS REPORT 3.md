No schedule changes.  

#### **Group Problems:**

Marcianne and myself, Alix, have been feeling distrust towards our third team member, Maia, for her failure to participate in week one, her failure to respond in week two, and now, her completion of unacceptable work, as outlined in the team charter, in week three. So, I contacted the professor about Marcianne's concerns and my concerns, and he suggested that I address her and outline what she committed to do, but did not. I complied with his suggestion, but the result backfired. Maia no longer agrees to communicate via Slack, and she has taken a professional concern and turned it into a personal one against herself.   

#### **Late Status Reports:**

* Each group member has checked in.
