The folders above were designed and developed to instruct first year students at the University of Texas at Arlington how to create their own personal schedule using the open-source platform, ClassScheduler. Media content for each file is stored in an assets file. Additionally, all files are composed in markdown. 

For ease of access, it is best to access the folders and media content in the following order:
1. [Introduction to ClassScheduler](https://github.com/umwrit350sp17/team6/tree/master/teamdocs/DRAFT%201/1-Introduction%20to%20ClassScheduler)
2. [Using CLassScheduler to Make a Personal Schedule]()
3. [Final Product and Troubleshooting]()
