# Using ClassScheduler to Make a Personal Schedule

### **Contributions:** 

One of the contributors to this document on how to operate ClassScheduler, **Alix Moody**, is a junior at the University of Mississippi. She is majoring in _Communication Sciences and Disorders_ and minoring in _Professional Writing_; her ultimate goal is to work as an audiologist for the **Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh** or for the **Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf**. 

Alix was responsible for developing **all** of the assets and README files, placing media content in appropriate places, and creating the _Final Product and Troubleshooting_ folder. The README files allow for users to navigate between folders _easily_ without misunderstandings; additionally, the assets files allows for the correct placement of images, while the images serve to **supplement** readers throughout the instructions. A major contribution that Alix made to the project was the development of the _Final Product and Troubleshooting_ folder, which allows users to **compare and contrast** their final schedule to a correct schedule. Furthermore, it offers readers a **resource** of common technological issues they may encounter when developing their own personal schedule with _ClassScheduler_.
