# Using ClassScheduler to Make a Personal Schedule

### **Team Members:** 
* One of the contributors to this document on how to operate ClassScheduler, Alix Moody, is a junior at the University of Mississippi. She is majoring in Communication Sciences and Disorders and minoring in Professional Writing; her ultimate goal is to work as an audiologist for the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh or for the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. Alix was responsible for developing all of the assets and README files, placing media content in appropriate places, and creating the Final Product and Troubleshooting folder. The README files allow for users to navigate between folders easily without misunderstandings; additionally, the assets files allows for the correct placement of images, while the images serve to supplement readers throughout the instructions. A major contribution that Alix made to the project was the development of the Final Product and Troubleshooting folder, which allows users to compare and contrast their final schedule to a correct schedule. Furthermore, it offers readers a resource of common technological issues they may encounter when developing their own personal schedule with ClassScheduler.
